KiaiMC is a simple plugin that enables players to receive XP in [Kiai](https://kiai.app) for their messages sent in-game.

This plugin uses [DiscordSRV](https://modrinth.com/plugin/discordsrv) as the linking system between your Minecraft server and Discord server, so make sure that you have it installed and setup using the `linking.yml` file in DiscordSRV's configuration, and have a chat channel set within Discord.

You can use the `global` channel you setup in DiscordSRV to add any multipliers or blacklists to in-game chat. User and role blacklists will be applied based on the Minecraft player's linked Discord account.
